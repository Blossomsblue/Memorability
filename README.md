[Abstract]

Recent work has shown that image memorability, in general, can be reliably predicted using some state-of-the-art features. However, all existing methods are not effective in predicting memorability of natural-scene images, far from human. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve the effectiveness of memorability prediction for natural-scene images. Specifically, we argue that some of HSV colors have either positive or negative impact on memorability of natural-scene images in our Natural-Scene Image Memorability (NSIM) dataset. Then, we develop an HSV-based feature for memorability prediction. Finally, the HSV-based feature is combined with other efficient state-of-the-art features in our approach to predict memorability on natural-scene images. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method.

[NSIM Dataset]

NSIM dataset includes 258 natura-scene images, which refer to non-object outdoor images. All images are voted by three participants and these images are all selected from the dataset provided by Isola et al..(Isola et al. (2011)) Moreover, hrs.mat includes the groundtruth memorability score corresponding to each image.
